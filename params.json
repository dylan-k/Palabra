{"name":"Palabra","tagline":"Tips, Tools and Technology for Writers","body":"# About this Project\r\n\r\nThis project is intended to provide two things for the 21st Century writer. First, a guide to version tracking, revision, and collaboration for writing. Second, a set of open-source tools for writers, including a writer's database useful for tracking submissions and a set of useful computer scripts for manipulating written texts and collections of written texts.\r\n\r\n*important note*: I'm just a writer looking for tools to help other writers do more powerful things with their text. This is my first Github project. I'm new to all of this and <a href=\"participate.html\">this project could use your input, contributions and advice</a>! I've blogged about my thoughts:\r\n\r\n- http://nocategories.net/tag/writing-tools/\r\n- http://nocategories.net/ephemera/writing/writing-submission-tools/\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nSignificant portions of the text on this site have been adapted from \"<a href=\"https://github.com/gewgaws/git-for-writers\">Git for Writers</a>\" which was originally created by <a href=\"https://github.com/gewgaws\">Gewgaws Lab</a> at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
