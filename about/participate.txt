## How to Participate

This is an open project. Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in helping writers benefit from using [Git](http://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com) and related services.

### What You'll Need

To contribute to the project, as well as to use Git in your own work,
you need:

1.  An [installation](http://book.git-scm.com/2_installing_git.html) of
    Git on your computer, configured with your name and email address
    (free)
2.  A GitHub [account](https://github.com/signup/free) (free)
3.  A private/public keypair for accessing your GitHub account; this may
    also mean installing [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/windows.html)
    on your computer if you are a Windows user.

### What You'll Do to Get a Copy to Edit

Once you have Git, your GitHub account, and your keys and OpenSSH
active, participating in the project is pretty simple:

1.  After logging into your GitHub account, go to [the 
    repository](https://github.com/dylan-k/Palabras) (repo) and
    fork a copy to your GitHub account by clicking on the Fork button.
2.  Once you have forked Git for Writers, you should do an initial pull
    from your copy of the repo by running \
     git pull git@github.com:**youraccount**/palabra.git,
    replacing **youraccount** with the name of your GitHub account.

### How to Edit Your Copy

The only thing you need to edit is a plain text editor; Sublime Text is
a good option for Mac users; Windows users might want to check out
Notepad++ (which is different from the Notepad that's included with
windows.

This project has [its own style guide](style-guide.htm), which you
should follow. Check out some of our existing pages (such as this one,
which is `participate.htm` in the repo) to see how the HTML is written.

### How to Keep Your Copy Current

To make sure you have the latest changes to the project, you'll want to set up a tracking branch ([read these GitHub instructions](http://github.com/guides/keeping-a-git-fork-in-sync-with-the-forked-repo)) and pull from and merge that branch regularly. In Git, you can just run git remote add gewgaws git://github.com/gewgaws/git-for-writers.git; to pull from that, run git pull gewgaws master into your tracking branch.

### What You'll Do to Submit Your Work

When you are ready to submit your work, be sure you have pushed to your copy of the Git for Writers repo on your GitHub account. Make sure you're logged into GitHub and navigate to the [the repository](https://github.com/dylan-k/Palabra). Click the Pull Request button, and select **gewgaws** as the recepient. Explain clearly in your message what your contribution to Git for Writers includes.
