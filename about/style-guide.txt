### Basic Markup

Like any good XHTML page, most of the markup for this project
consists of headings, paragraphs, and lists.

#### Headings

The **names of pages** are placed in `<h2>` tags; there should only be
one `<h2>` heading per page.

The **major divisions** of a page should be written in `<h3>` tags.
There can be multiple `<h3>` tags per page.

The major divisions of a page can be broken into smaller
**sub-divisions**, marked using `<h4>` tags. There can be multiple
`<h4>` subdivisions within a major division.

#### Paragraphs

Most running paragraph text appears in the basic `<p>` tag.

Quotations of long stretches of text can appear in the `<blockquote>`
tag, but the quoted material must also be marked by either paragraph
tags or, in the case of a quotation of a list, using the list tags (see
the Lists section of this document):

    <p>
      According to the 
      <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git homepage</a>,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Git is a free &amp;  open source, distributed version 
        control system designed to handle everything from 
        small to very large projects with speed and 
        efficiency.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

That will render something like this:

According to the [Git homepage](http://git-scm.com),

> Git is a free &amp;  open source, distributed version control system
> designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
> speed and efficiency.

#### Lists

For steps in a process or anything where order matters, use the ordered
list, `<ol>`:

    <ol>
      <li>Download Git</li>
      <li>Install Git</li>
      <li>Love Git</li>
    </ol>

1.  Download Git
2.  Install Git
3.  Love Git

For lists of things whose order does not matter, use the unordered list,
`<ul>`:

    <ul>
      <li>We love Git</li>
      <li>Yes we do</li>
      <li>We love Git, how about you?</li>
    </ul>

-   We love Git
-   Yes we do
-   We love Git, how about you?

### Basic Phrase Markup

You can **make short bits of text bold** (`<strong>`), add *a little
emphasis* (`<em>`), or refer to the title of a work, Git for Writers
(`<cite>`).

### Git-related Markup

Because Git is a command-line tool, most interaction with it occurs
through text, in a terminal. There are three different tags to use for
marking up Git input, output, and interactions:

1.  `kbd`: Use the `<kbd>` element for anything someone would type. For
    example, `<kbd>git status</kbd>` appears as git status.
2.  `samp`: Use the `<samp>` element for single-line responses from Git.
    For example, `<samp># On branch master</samp>` appears as \# On
    branch master.
3.  `pre`: Use the `<pre>` element for multi-line interactions with Git.
    Output that appears in red (in many environments) can be marked
    using `<span class="warn">`, and output that appears in green can be
    marked as `<span class="good">`. Git sometimes outputs angle
    brackets, so be sure to escape those (`&amp; lt;` for `<`, `&amp; gt;` for
    `>`):

<!-- -->

    <pre>
    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD &amp; lt;file&amp; gt;---" to unstage)
    #
    #   <span class="good">modified:   css/screen.css</span>
    #
    # Changed but not updated:
    #   (use "git add &amp; lt;file&amp; gt;---" to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- &amp; lt;file&amp; gt;---" to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #   <span class="warn">modified:   style-guide.htm</span>
    #
    </pre>

    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>---" to unstage)
    #
    #   modified:   css/screen.css
    #
    # Changed but not updated:
    #   (use "git add <file>---" to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>---" to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #   modified:   style-guide.htm
