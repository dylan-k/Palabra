# How Many Kinds of Principalities There Are, and By What Means They Are Acquired 

All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are
either republics or principalities.

Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long
established; or they are new.

The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are,
as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has
acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of the King of Spain.

Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to
live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or
of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
