# Palabra

Palabra is a set of tools for writers. These tools go beyond the usual abilities provided by a standard wordprocessor. They include:

- scripts to help you leave Microsoft Word behind
- templates to rapidly format writings in Standard Manuscript Format
- resources for learning the Markdown file format and Pandoc conversion program
- template for formatting a book from a set of writings
- a writer's database useful for tracking submissions

note: I'm just a writer looking for tools to help other writers do more powerful things with their text. This is my first Github project. I'm new to all of this and I could use your help! I've blogged about my thoughts:
