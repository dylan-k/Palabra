Since version 0.4, the "submissions" table now stores 'sub_file' data as a text string. This text should be the filename of a file that sits within this directory. Work is in progress on a macro in the database form, to make it easier to store/retrieve files using this field. For now, just enter the filename manually and be sure that the file is in this directory.

Be sure not to rename any of the files once they're in here and described by the database.
