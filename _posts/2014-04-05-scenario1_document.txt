### University policies

#### Grading Criteria

A - Student has turned in all required components of a project, the work
is exceptional in quality, and reflects the student's dedication to
adjusting the project to his or her own interests.

B - Student has turned in all required components of a project and
submitted work that is acceptable as graduate level.

C - Student has turned in all required components of a project, but the
work is below graduate level.

E - Student has not turned in all required components of a project.

#### Attendance and Participation

Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own
success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole.
However, if you absolutely must miss, you must contact the instructor
ahead of time via email.

#### Academic Honesty

As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the Code of
Academic Honesty in the [Undergraduate Student Handbook](). All work for
this course should be your own original effort, including print and
digital page design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of
text, as well as any use of open source code libraries and images not of
your own making, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically
warranted and rhetorically appropriate.

If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that
in whole or in part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please
contact me immediately and before the work is due. The consequences of
academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates the Code of
Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a
failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the
Department of Humanities and the Associate Dean of Graduate Academic
Affairs, who may take additional disciplinary action.

#### Special Needs Statement

Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that
might affect their ability to perform in class should contact me
privately, either in person or via email, at the start of the semester.
Methods, materials, or deadlines will be adapted as required to ensure
equitable participation.
